# Detect object

## For educational purpose

I use yolov5 to create a model which can recognize the ligthtraffic, specifically red light, this model would we used for cars. 

There is an option to run semaforo_detect_object.ipynb in google colab(it may produce an msg for an update in the fare)

all the libraries to use check requirements.txt

Be sure to run in a virtual env. 

I use Pycharm and VSC both at the end it works on both, using the terminal.

In order to run Detect:

pip install -r https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ultralytics/yolov5/master/requirements.txt
